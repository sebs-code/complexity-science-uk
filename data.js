It built on an ESRC-supported seminar series on 'Socio-economic dynamics', and two EC network projects co-ordinated from Warwick ('Unifying networks in science and society' and 'Complex financial markets') and the work of a number of research groups such as: The Centre for Fusion, Space & Astrophysics; Information Systems Research Unit; Centre for Primary Health Care Studies; and Systems Biology.

      "description": "The Institute for Complex Systems Simulation (ICSS), of the University of Southampton, has concluded its doctoral training centre (DTC), and pleasingly, has fulfilled its mission to recruit, develop and graduate research leaders and pioneers of complexity science. Our PhD graduates are field specialists, able to analyse, innovate and exploit complex systems models and methodologies. Moreover, the thesis outputs spanned almost the full range of academic research in the university, from the study of flamingo feeding patterns in Kenya and climate dynamics in the Arctic, to the fundamental understanding of mechanical properties in biological membranes and the potential uses of micromagnetics in data storage devices. All projects were complexity focused, addressing the emerging behaviour from complex systems, with a significant simulation or mathematical component. Many of our projects had very direct societal relevance, including human sexual behaviour, while others addressed more fundamental but important physical principles, such as non-equilibrium processes in dynamic systems."
